# `nate.utils`
A somewhat unstructured place for Nate to dump functions that have been abstracted to the point that they may be useful to future Nate or others. If the need arises to further organize functions by themes, I'll return to the somewhat unorganized nature of the package.

# Installation
To install the most recent version of `nate.utils` run:

#install.packages("devtools") # if not already

devtools::install_github("natehall329/nate_utils")
